# Songle
Contains server and client side code for Songle.


## To build: 

1. Clone repo into a local directory
2. Open client.py and make sure HOST is set to 'localhost' (if you run server from another device, set it to that device IP)
3. Run server.py and then client.py. The later has commandline arguments with test keys. Try `python client.py 002` to play a song that is internaly stored as 002.wav
